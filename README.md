#### Description:
Being able to stand on one leg for 15 seconds or longer is a sign of good body
balance and can be a helpful indicator of lower fall risk in older adults. In Thailand,
which is a rapidly aging society, one out of three older adults falls annually, and
some of them die due to head injuries and other severe injuries.
The inspiration that led me to create this application is that I always see my
sister teaching and encouraging my 72 year old dad to practice body balancing and
keep his body healthy. My dad has a risk of falls, but he can stand on one leg for
over 15 seconds. However, he doesn't stop there he always keeps his body healthy
by eating healthily and staying active. Unfortunately, not every aging person in
Thailand has the same opportunity as my dad to have a doctor who can teach and
encourage them as my sister did with my dad. So, I decided to create an application
to help them improve their muscle strength, which is the major cause of falls in the
elderly because muscle mass decreases as we age. Then I researched how to teach
the elderly to stand on one leg with advice from my sister.
The application has a countdown timer that users have to perform balancing
exercises that display on each page within a time frame before moving on to the next
exercise. There is also a lung animation above the countdown timer and sounds that
users have to control their breathing with. But why do we have to control our
breathing? I found that my dad always holds his breath when doing balance
exercises, but this is not good because holding your breath can actually make it more
difficult to maintain your body balance. It can cause tension in your muscles and
make it harder to focus on the task at hand. The inhalation rate that I used for this
application is suitable for doing balance exercises. For sounds, I used
AVSpeechSynthesizer to convert text to speech.
