# SafeSteps
## My CS50x Final Project
#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/fukTwazuw2c>
#### Description:
The application has a countdown timer that users have to perform balancing
exercises that display on each page within a time frame before moving on to the next
exercise. There is also a lung animation above the countdown timer and sounds that
users have to control their breathing with. But why do we have to control our
breathing? I found that my dad always holds his breath when doing balance
exercises, but this is not good because holding your breath can actually make it more
difficult to maintain your body balance. It can cause tension in your muscles and
make it harder to focus on the task at hand. The inhalation rate that I used for this
application is suitable for doing balance exercises. For sounds, I used
AVSpeechSynthesizer to convert text to speech.
