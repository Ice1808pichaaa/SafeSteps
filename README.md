## Description

The **SafeSteps** application aims to address the issue of falls in older adults, particularly in Thailand, where one out of three older adults experiences falls annually. These falls can lead to severe injuries and, in some cases, even fatalities due to head injuries. The inspiration behind creating this app comes from a personal experience of witnessing the importance of body balancing exercises for an aging family member.

### Background
In a rapidly aging society like Thailand, not every elderly individual has access to personalized guidance on maintaining good body balance. The creator's father, a 72-year-old with a risk of falls, inspired the development of SafeSteps. Despite the risks, the father is proactive about his health, regularly practicing body balancing exercises under the guidance of a family member.

### Purpose
SafeSteps focuses on improving muscle strength, a critical factor in preventing falls among the elderly. As individuals age, muscle mass naturally decreases, making them more susceptible to balance-related issues. The application provides a structured approach to help users enhance their balance and reduce the risk of falls.

### Features
The application includes the following key features:

1. **Countdown Timer:**
   - Users engage in balancing exercises displayed on each page within a specified time frame.

2. **Breathing Control:**
   - An animated lung icon accompanies the countdown timer, prompting users to control their breathing during exercises.
   - Holding one's breath during balance exercises can create tension in muscles and hinder focus. SafeSteps addresses this by encouraging controlled breathing.

3. **Audio Guidance:**
   - Utilizes AVSpeechSynthesizer to convert text to speech for audio guidance.
   - The inhalation rate is tailored for balance exercises, providing users with auditory cues to enhance their experience.

### How to Use
Users follow a sequence of balancing exercises, guided by the countdown timer and audio instructions. Each exercise aims to improve muscle strength and overall balance. It is recommended to use the application regularly to experience long-term benefits.

By creating SafeSteps, the developer hopes to contribute to the well-being of older adults in Thailand and beyond, empowering them to lead healthier, more active lives.
